#### Simplifying Complexity: Unraveling the Shape of Neural Data
Our collaborative research group is dedicated to advancing the understanding of neural data through a geometry-driven, neuroscience-informed approach to data science. We employ computational methods to dissect and interpret the complex patterns inherent in neural datasets.

**Mission:** Our collaborative research group is dedicated to advancing the understanding of neural data through a geometry-driven, neuroscience-informed approach to data science. We employ computational methods to dissect and interpret the complex patterns inherent in neural datasets. Our focus is on developing both conceptual and computational tools to make neural data more understandable and accessible, using AI models as virtual organisms for exploring principles of representation learning and for the validation of our methods.

**Vision:** We aspire to create innovative tools and concepts that advance the fields of cognitive neuroscience, AI research, and clinical practices. Our goal is to reveal and understand the hidden structures of neural data, paving the way for groundbreaking discoveries and innovations. We envision a future where our contributions significantly enhance the comprehension and application of neural geometry in various scientific and practical domains.

**What We Do:**

- **Crafting Tools:** We develop conceptual and computational tools to uncover and explore patterns in neural data, making them more understandable and accessible.
- **Modeling with AI:** Our AI models serve as virtual organisms, aiding in the exploration of fundamental principles of representation learning and the validation of our analytical methods.
- **Unraveling Neural Geometry:** By focusing on the geometry and topology of neural data, we aim to reveal their hidden underlying structures.
