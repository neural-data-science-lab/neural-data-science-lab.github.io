Justus has pursued research occupations ever since working on his Bachelor’s degree in Jena. Before this, he has worked as a working student in software engineering at Salesforce.

His academic interests lie in the application of data science methods to extract valuable insights from data, and making complex data more understandable. His Bachelor’s thesis focused on the use of transformers for data imputation, which further ignited his enthusiasm for the field. At this Lab, he is working on scalable self-supervised deep representation of neuroimaging data and their explainability.

He is also passionate about volunteering in the international community.
